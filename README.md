# Function A Day

## Aims

Write a function everyday. In any language, maybe even multiple. It can do anything you want it to, but it must:

 - be properly documented in the format recommend as per that language.
 - be "functional" in so far as it performs the desired function and builds successfully without errors or warnings (when required as per each language etc).
 - have the proper testing implemented.
 - NOT use AI to write any part of the function.
